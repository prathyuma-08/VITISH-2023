#Obscene Media Detection Solution
## Problem Statement
Design and develop a technological solution for identifying and blocking any obscene media (image/video/audio) at the userâ€™s end. The solution should be able to send alerts to the concerned nodal agency in case of the spread of such content. The solution may be in the form of a desktop/mobile application or a web browser plugin.

## Complexity of the Problem
Finding a suitable dataset for training the models was challenging as there is no public dataset available for obscene media.
The project involves developing models to classify between safe and unsafe media across various formats, including images and videos.
The implementation of the solution requires the use of deep learning frameworks and techniques.
## Novelty of the Project
The solution involves using ensemble learning to combine multiple models, including InceptionV3 and ResNet50, for improved accuracy in identifying obscene media.
The project also involved scraping actual image porn sites to obtain more relevant data and using GAN to upscale the images for better classification accuracy.
The solution incorporates the use of frame-by-frame checking for video classification, increasing the accuracy of the model.
## Feasibility
The use of browser extensions as a technological solution is highly feasible due to the widespread use of web browsers.
The implementation of the solution only requires the user to install the browser extension, making it easily accessible and user-friendly.
The solution can be integrated with other existing applications or websites, making it even more versatile.
## Scalability
The use of browser extensions allows for easy scalability as it does not require any additional infrastructure or resources.
The solution can be easily updated or improved by modifying the code within the browser extension.
The solution can also be deployed across multiple platforms, including desktop and mobile devices, making it highly scalable.
## Usage
To use the solution, simply download and install the browser extension on your preferred web browser. Once installed, the solution will automatically scan and classify any media viewed on the browser. If any obscene media is detected, an alert will be sent to the concerned nodal agency for further action.

## Conclusion
The obscene media detection solution is a novel and feasible solution to a complex problem. The use of ensemble learning, frame-by-frame checking, and scraping actual image porn sites has increased the accuracy of the model. The use of browser extensions makes the solution easily accessible and scalable, making it a versatile solution for identifying and blocking any obscene media.
